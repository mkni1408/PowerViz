	::::::How to write a simulation:::::
	
	Simulations are divided into timeblocks. Each timeblock can be run once or multiple times.
	Timeblocks look like this:
	<time at="00:00:00" >
	</time>
	
	Timeblocks that will run once should use the 'at' argument. The timecode MUST have the format "hh:mm:ss".
	Omitting a single digit will crash the system.
	
	If a timeblock should be repeated, it should use the following form:
	<time every="00:01:00" offset="00:00:20" repeat="10">
	</time>
	
	The above timeblock will be run every minute, with a 20 second offset. The timeblock will run 10 times.
	Repeat and offset can be omitted.
	
	Timeblock has another argument that will limit repeats.
	until="hh:mm:ss" will stop the repeating of a timeblock after the specified simulation time.
	
	Inside timeblocks, two different types os instructions are possible:
	Load and supply.
	
	These either set, add to or subtract from the outlet 0 load:
	<load outlet="0" set="100" /> or
	<load outlet="0" add="400" />
	<load outlet="0" sub="100" />
	
	To set the power source to coal:
	<supply source="coal" />
	Possible strings are coal, wind, water, sun and nuclear.
	
	All instructions have an optional comment argument, to display comments on screen during the simulation run.

	This simulation is of a standard home.
	
	
	The outlets available are:
	
	Kitchen:
	0: Kitches table. Used for boiler and other kitchen machines.
	1: Stove. Used for cooking.
	2: Freezer.
	3: Fridge.
	
	Living room:
	4: TV, Playstation and MediaCenter.
	5: Lamp over cofee table.
	6: Lamp over dinner table. Dimmable.
